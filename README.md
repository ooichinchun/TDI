## Analysis of High-Rise Public Housing Prices in Singapore (March 2012 - July 2017) (TDI)

Public records for public housing resale prices have been downloaded and post-processed for the following plots.

### Time-consistency of Resale Prices

| **Resale Price Index (2009-2017)** |

Governmental data for Resale Price Index (normalized at 100.0 to Q1 2009) shows a gradual appreciation till a peak in 2013, before prices stabilize in 2015 at a more moderate level.

This does suggest that prices in this data-set have to take year of sale into account for analysis.
Alternatively, prices can be restricted to 2015-2017 to avoid confounding effects.

### Location of Resale Flats Across Singapore

Initial data as retrieved from data.gov.sg provides resale information in actual address. We have used a Google API to convert these addresses into GPS coordinates for unified cross-referencing.
